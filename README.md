# dobos_tortes

This is strictly a library of documentation that I've created. To assist me in finding digestable
information for the use of programs I like to use, or plan to eventually use... or.. well, it's
documentation, none the less.

You're obviously welcome to thumb through, add to or revise using push's, and other git
activity. I'm no pro, I'm not sponsored, I don't seek notability, just leaving this here
for myself. I don't always want to log in to services just read stuff,  sometimes. Like I said,
make some coffee(drink of preference), kick your feet up, put your happy hackin' hat on, and 
be you.

I typically try to make a habbit of grooming the naming schema into a kinda sorta something of
a easy to figure out what's inside name. I also try to, instead of using subsections, insert
what is normal used as a subsection of a document, into its' own text file. I also avoid the
use of directories. Though, you'll notice each program will be found it its' own directory.
I don't like labrinthian directory structures. They tend to be harder to manager and track
variation, or even duplication.

Naming schema is as follows(alas!)

$program_name-NN-$document_tier.$class.$descript.ext

P.S., Write github.com a letter..... this auto styling embedded in my README.md is not
      acceptable..... "but, sebastian, read the documents." Yeah, I got your documents
      right here, pal.
